                <p>Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny</p>
                <p>Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis</p>
                <p>Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money</p>
                <p>And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorc√©e do it?"</p>
                <p>The wedding was charming, if a little gauche</p>
                <p>There's only so far new money goes</p>
                <p>They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"</p>
                <p>Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud</p>
                <p>The doctor had told him to settle down</p>
                <p>It must have been her fault his heart gave out</p>
            
                <br>
            
                <p>And they said</p>
                <p>"There goes the last great American dynasty</p>
                <p>Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been</p>
                <p>There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen</p>
                <p>She had a marvelous time ruining everything"</p>
          
                <br>
           
                <p>Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever</p>
                <p>Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city</p>
                <p>Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names</p>
                <p>And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet</p>
                <p>And losing on card game bets with Dali</p>
          
                <br>
            
                <p>And they said</p>
                <p>"There goes the last great American dynasty</p>
                <p>Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been</p>
                <p>There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen</p>
                <p>She had a marvelous time ruining everything"</p>

                <br>
            
                <p>They say she was seen on occasion</p>
                <p>Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea</p>
                <p>And in a feud with her neighbor</p>
                <p>She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green</p>
                <p>50 years is a long time</p>
                <p>Holiday House sat quietly on that beach</p>
                <p>Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits</p>
                <p>And then it was bought by me</p>

                <br>
            
                <p>Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been</p>
                <p>There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen</p>
                <p>I had a marvelous time ruining everything</p>
                <p>I had a marvelous time ruining everything</p>
                <p>A marvelous time ruining everything</p>
                <p>A marvelous time</p>
                <p>I had a marvelous time</p>
