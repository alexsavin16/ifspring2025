            <h1>Apple Pie Recipe</h1>
            <p>Apple pie recipe from Kierin Baldwin, Adapted by Sam Sifton, The New York Times</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2½ pounds apples, peeled and cored, then cut into wedges (5 large honeycrisps will do it)</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>¾ cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>1 <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12319-all-purpose-pie-dough">all-purpose pie dough</a></li>
                <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
            
            <ul>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
                <p>Melt butter in a large skillet set over medium-high heat and add apples to the pan. Stir to coat fruit with butter and cook, stirring occasionally.</p>

            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <p>Meanwhile, whisk together the spices, salt and ¾ cup sugar, and sprinkle this over the pan, stirring to combine. Lower heat and cook until apples have started to soften, approximately 5 to 7 minutes.</p>

            <h3>Step 3</h3>
                <p>Sprinkle the flour and cornstarch over the apples and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, another 3 to 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat, add cider vinegar, stir and scrape fruit mixture into a bowl and allow to cool completely. (The fruit mixture will cool faster if spread out on a rimmed baking sheet.)</p>

            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <p>Place a large baking sheet on the middle rack of oven and preheat to 425. Remove one disc of dough from the refrigerator and, using a pin, roll it out on a lightly floured surface until it is roughly 12 inches in diameter.</p>

            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <p>Fit this crust into a 9-inch pie plate, trimming it to leave a ½-inch overhang. Place this plate, with the dough, in the freezer. Roll out the remaining dough on a lightly floured surface until it is roughly 10 or 11 inches in diameter.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <p>Remove pie crust from freezer and put the cooled pie filling into it. Cover with remaining dough.</p>

            <h3>Step 7</h3>
            <p>Press the edges together, trim the excess, then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork. Using a sharp knife, cut four or so steam vents in the top of the crust.</p>

            <h3>Step 8</h3>
            <p>Lightly brush the top of the pie with egg wash and sprinkle with remaining tablespoon of sugar.</p>

            <h3>Step 9</h3>
            <p>Place pie in oven and bake on hot baking sheet for 20 minutes, then reduce temperature to 375. Continue to cook until the interior is bubbling and the crust is golden brown, about 30 to 40 minutes more. Remove and allow to cool on a windowsill or kitchen rack, about two hours.</p>

            <h2>Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
            <h4>(I chose some non-recipe, but food-related websites)</h4>
            <p><a href="https://theplotline.org/">The Plotline</a>: The movement and scrolling of this website. Also the interaction of the sections that respond to the mouse. </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.eatbanza.com/">Banza</a> and <a href="https://www.eatbanza.com/blogs/recipes">Banza Recipes</a>: I really like the use of color and movement on this page. Simple, strong color palette and typefaces, and the moving squiggly lines.</p>
            <p><a href="https://en.manayerbamate.com/">Mana Yerba Mate</a>: I think the visuals on this page are so cool. It is very interactive and bold. The game at the bottom is funny.</p>


            <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.addaveggie.com/recipes">AddaVeggie main site</a> and <a href="https://www.addaveggie.com/recipe-adda-veggie-loaf">Sample recipe page</a>: I like the simplicity and layout on the recipe page.</p>
            <p><a href="https://nutshed.ie/blogs/post">Nutshed main site</a> and <a href="https://nutshed.ie/blogs/post/snickers-celebration-cheesecake">Sample recipe page</a>: Fun colors. I do not like how everything is laid out so vertically.I guess it makes sense to follow a step-by-step recipe, but I prefer the more grid-like side, rather than this paragraph or vertical section format.</p>
            <p><a href="https://omsom.com/blogs/second-menu/tagged/blog-recipes">Omsom main site</a> and <a href="https://omsom.com/blogs/second-menu/crispy-sheetpan-noodles-with-tofu">Sample recipe page</a>: I like the colors and typefaces. I think it works well because it is more concise than the previous. I like the movement, like the &#8220Hungry for more?&#8221 banner is fun.</p>
