        <h1>Alex's Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>My name is Alex. I am a senior. I have a double major in Communication Design and Romance Languages & Literatures (French, Spanish, and Italian).</li>
            <li>I am from New Jersey and I transferred to WashU last fall from Parsons Paris. While this class was my last graduation requirement, as a ComDes major, I think the skills taught in this class are very important to my future career.</li>
            <li>I have very little experience with HTML and CSS, but I have worked with them before. I took a workshop class on html coding at Parsons, with more of a design focus, but I did not feel like I took much away from it and want to graduate having these skills.</li>
            <li>By the end of this class I hope to be able to code html without the need to refer to sources, to be able to code a (basic) site on my own.</li>
            <li>I think that designing for screen has many more limitations than for paper and it requires more adaptation.</li>
